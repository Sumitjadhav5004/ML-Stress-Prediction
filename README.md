## 📌 Project Description

The goal of this project is to predict **stress levels** based on sleep, activity, and lifestyle features using classical Machine Learning algorithms.

The project includes:
- Data loading and preprocessing  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Visualization utilities  
- Model training and evaluation  
- Confusion matrix and other metric visualizations
